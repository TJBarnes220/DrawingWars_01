# DrawingWars_01
This is a demo of Drawing Wars, a game made for the purpose of an app competition at my University.
The main source of my work can be found in the the directory /app/src/main/java/com/example/travis/.
This is where all my classes/objects are stored that my game uses to actually function. The directory
/app/src/main/res/layout/ contains all the xml files used as layouts for the many activities of the app.
Unfortunately the app was not optimized to fit all screen sizes so it only currently works on screens of 
size 480 x 800.
